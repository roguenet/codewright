A list of half baked ideas for future blog posts

 * Game UI in Flump

 * Microtome (needs some repository cleanup and coordination with Tim first).

 * "I am not a real Indie"
 ** Indies are seen as having this responsibility to forward the medium and not worry about petty
    things like income. I feel no such obligation and partially resent the idea that if you're
    making games on your own, you need to be pushing boundaries and doing other super risky shit.
