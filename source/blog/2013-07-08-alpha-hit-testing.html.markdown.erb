title: Alpha hit testing in Flump
tags: actionscript, flump
---

As I mentioned in my
[initial post](http://codewright.roguenet.org/blog/2013/07/03/initial-post.html), I'm using
[Flump](https://github.com/threerings/flump) for level export to the client. The levels for the
game I'm building involve lots of tightly packed assets that have overlapping bound boxes.
