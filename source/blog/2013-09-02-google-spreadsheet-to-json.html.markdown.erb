title: Google Spreadsheets for Game Configuration
tags: java, json

Dynamic game configuration is always useful, and doing it cheaply and easily is especially
important for indies. Setting up a Google Spreadsheet with your runtime configuration data enables
easy collaborative editing, and having a process that can read that data and export json makes
it easy to use that data at runtime in whatever client language you find suitable. In this article
I'm using GSon for JSON serialization, but it wouldn't be difficulty to use Jasper instead.
