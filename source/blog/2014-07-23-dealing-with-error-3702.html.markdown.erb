title: Dealing with Stage3D Error 3702

### The Problem

```Stage3D```'s Error #3702 is the "[Context3D not available](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/runtimeErrors.html)"
error that may occur if you try to initialize ```Stage3D``` with an unsupported profile. In
[Starling](http://gamua.com/starling/), this error is typically handled by Starling itself, and
results in a dark red warning across the stage with a message like "Context 3D not available!
Possible reasons: wrong wmode or missing device support." If you're like me, this error never
happens on your own machines or devices, but you start getting complaints from players that they
can't play your game, and you have no idea why.

I ended up adding an automated bug report to my web build when this particular case comes up to see
just how many people are affected, and I was shocked by how quickly I landed a pile of bug reports.
I don't have specific player affected percentage numbers, but it turned out not to be the very rare
case that I had previously assumed it is, so I promptly freaked out and flailed around for a few
hours, trying to get that flood of reports down to a trickle. It was happening across all modern
browsers, OSs and Flash versions; there seemed to be no rhyme or reason.

### The Flailing

I did a lot of googling, and found that some people were encountering this problem, but did not
find a good general case solution. A lot of the posts I found spread around the Internet showed
a general lack of understanding and confusion about why some people were affected and not others.
I finally came across [a post](http://forums.rebuildgame.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=741) on the
[Rebuild](http://rebuildgame.com/) game forums with the same problem. Rebuild is a fantastic series
of games built by the incredible [Sarah Northway](http://northwaygames.com/). The forum post
looked like she'd probably found a solution. It wasn't posted there, so I bugged her on twitter and
she generously shared her erudite wisdom with me. The solution found here is hers, adapted a bit.

### Context3D Profiles

The first thing to understand about this error is what the various
[Context3DProfile](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display3D/Context3DProfile.html)s
are, and why you might want to use each one.

####A quick (by no means comprehensive) breakdown:
* ```Context3DProfile.BASELINE_CONSTRAINED```. This is the lowest common denoninator profile. If you
  can get all the functionality you want from this profile, you can just use it and ignore the rest
  of this article. If you want to use large (4096x4096) textures or Rectangular textures, you want
  to avoid this proile.

* ```Context3DProfile.BASELINE```. This is the middleground profile. The main advantage over
  ```BASELINE_CONSTRAINED``` is that it supports rectangular (instead of only square) textures.
  Starling blurs this limitation by doing an expensive (time and memory) ```Bitmap``` copy of your
  source art from the rectangle it came in to the appropriate square size if it must.

* ```Context3DProfile.BASELINE_EXTENDED```. If you want to use 4096x4096 textures, you must run in
  this profile. If you want to run on older devices, you'll need to have multiple versions of your
  textures at different sizes so that your game can still run if it must degrade to a lower profile.

### The Counterfeit Solution

Adobe recently added [```Stage3D.requestContext3DMatchingProfiles```](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/Stage3D.html#requestContext3DMatchingProfiles())
which Starling added support for by passing a ```Vector.<String>``` of profiles in for the profile
parameter of the ```Starling constructor```. This was meant to automate this process, correctly
degrading through profiles until one is found that will work on the current computer or device.
Unfortunately, Adobe appears to have flubbed it; this method no longer appears to support
[```Context3DRenderMode.AUTO```](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display3D/Context3DRenderMode.html#AUTO),
which is the mechanism that lets ```Stage3D``` init fall back to software rendering if it must.
This can happen if the computer doesn't have hardware acceleration support, or (more likely) the
player has turned off hardware acceleration for the Flash Player.

The result is that if you try to use the new ```requestContext3DMatchingProfiles```
method, you can end up landing a nasty Error #3702, even if you passed in all of the ```Context3D```
profiles.

### Code Time

The solution that Sarah (and now also [Mosaic Medley](https://www.facebook.com/games/?fbs=100&app_id=271506213020723))
uses is to attempt intialization of each profile in order using the older
[```Stage3D.requestContext3D```](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/Stage3D.html#requestContext3D()) function, catching errors and moving on to the next
until a working ```Context3DProfile``` is found. With appropriate embed settings
(```wmode=direct```), and requiring a modern Flash version (12.0.0 is good enough for my uses),
I have yet to receive an Error #3702 using this approach.

The crux is in how we initialize Stage3D:

<%= render_code("App.as", "actionscript", :range => [50,113]) %>

Note that I'm using a ```Future``` here. This is from the reactive programming library for
actionscript, [React](https://github.com/tconkling/react-as3), which I cannot recommend enough.
```Promise``` is simply the concrete implementation of ```Future```.

The rest of the implementation is pretty straightforward. We start with a class that extends
```Sprite```, and start the ```Stage3D``` init when we're added to the stage:

<%= render_code("App.as", "actionscript", :range => [18,28]) %>

```initStarling``` is given the profile ```String``` by the ```Future``` that ```initStage3D```
returns. I found that on some platforms, ```Stage3D.context3D.profile``` was mysteriously missing.
I didn't find a reason for it, and didn't dig further because I was able to just pass it around
myself. Perhaps this problem is also why Starling requires that you pass the configured profile
in to the constructor.

The last bit to understand is that when we pass the already initialized ```Stage3D``` instance in
to Starling, it will assume that it's sharing that ```Stage3D``` with another framework, which
modifies its behavior in several ways. Since we're not actually sharing the ```Stage3D``` around,
we can reset the ```shareContext``` property on the Starling instance before continuing with
init:

<%= render_code("App.as", "actionscript", :range => [30,48]) %>

That's it! Hopefully this can clear up some of the general Error #3702 confusion out there. If you
have any questions, comments or find a problem with the code here, leave it in a comment below.
