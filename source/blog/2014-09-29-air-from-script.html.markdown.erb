title: Command-line AIR support
tags: actionscript

Running an Actionscript project from the command-line is not something that is frequently required
(and I would certainly not recommend using Actionscript as a general scripting language), but there
are corner cases where it is occasionally useful to do so. For instance, I have recently
been working on recoloring system (topic for a future blog post!) stacked on top of
[Flump](https://github.com/threerings/flump), and the tools require that we do some post-processing
on the Flump output. This processing requires both parsing the Flump library (for which we already
have code written in Actionscript), and the opening and exporting of SWF assets
which can only be done from within Actionscript. This process does not need any buttons or
display to run; it can be entirely automated, or it could be if it were easy to run Actionscript
from the command-line.

You can get most of the way there by [launching a compiled AIR app from the command-line](http://blogs.adobe.com/simplicity/2008/11/how_to_launch_an_air_app_from_the_command_line.html).
However, while that might be handy for using a script to launch a typical, visual AIR app, it has
a couple of problems for our purposes. For one, the compiled app is huge (the tiny included
app in this post runs ~50MB when compiled as a standalone Mac .app package). For another, you can't
write directly to ```stdout``` from AIR (which is strange, since you can access ```stdout```,
```stderr``` and ```stdin``` in
[native process which you spawn](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/desktop/NativeProcess.html)).

If you happen to find yourself in the rare circumstance of needing to run a build process or art
pipeline task in Actionscript, perhaps this can help you out. I'm running with the assumption that
this is executed on a machine with developer tools installed, so it executes ADL directly rather
than operating on a compiled AIR app. To get around the lack of stdout support, I write to a file
and tail it from a bash script, wrapping the whole thing up into a package that is pretty typical
for a command-line script. It does need to be executed in an environment that has windowing support,
so this may not be suitable for a typical build server, but I leave that problem as an exercise for
someone who actually needs to solve it.

First, we have a very simple sample app:

<%= render_code("App.as", "actionscript", :range => [11,41]) %>

As you can see, we get access to our command-line arguments via ```InvokeEvent.arguments```, we
can easily write our output to a temporary file instead of using ```trace```, and the app can take
as long as necessary to complete (including running over multiple frames if needed).

AIR apps require an app descriptor:

<%= render_code("airdesc.xml", "xml") %>

This descriptor is just putting forth minimal effort to actually launch the app with ADL.

Finally, a bash script to run the whole thing:

<%= render_code("app-run.sh", "bash") %>

We have to do a little bit of process gymnastics to make this act like a typical command-line
script. Primarily, this just means launching both ADL and the tail process in the background, then
waiting for ADL to complete before performing some cleanup.

The ```bin/``` directory that contains the script should also contain the AIR descriptor XML file,
and the compiled SWF containing ```App.as```. That's all there is to it! Hopefully people don't
need something like this very often because it's a nasty hack and isn't a good solution to very many
problems, but if you have something that absolutely must run in Actionscript as close to headless
as possible, there it is.
